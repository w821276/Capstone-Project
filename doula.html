<h2>Did you know that there is currently a Black Maternal Mortality Crisis within the United States?</h2>
<p class="fw-bold">Yes, you read that right. Unfortunately, there is a Black Maternal Mortality Crisis going on within the United States of America. 
    With an average of 20.1 maternal deaths/100k live births, the US is the most dangerous developed country in which to give birth. For black women, the most frequent victims of our crisis-level maternal mortality rates, the odds are even worse.

    According to the most recent data, the maternal death rate for black women is more than double that of white women: 44.0 deaths per 100,000 live births compared to 17.9. It was also more than three times the rate for Hispanic women at 12.6.
    
    
    These statistics represent deaths up through 42 days postpartum, the time when most women attend their single postpartum appointment. There is no data on the amount of deaths from postpartum complications past this marker â€” most significantly, around postpartum depression and other mental health issues. In actuality, the number of deaths are likely higher than reported..</p>


    <p2 class="fw-bold">Doulas are trained birth workers who provide families with mental, spiritual, emotional and physical support before, during and after pregnancy. 
        There is researched evidence that a doula can increase a more positive outcome and assist with lowering the alarming statistics of the overrall maternal health crisis within the United States. </p2>
    <p3 class="fw-bold">
    Being a Doula is heartwork for me. The majority of my work is voluntarily done within low income households. I overstand the struggle and find joy in putting a dent the Black Maternal Health Crisis. </p3>
